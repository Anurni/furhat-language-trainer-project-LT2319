## Furhat the spoken language instructor (Final course project for L2319 - Dialogue Systems II) - Anni Nieminen

 This respository holds my code, additional sound files for the final course project of L2319.
 This repository also holds my project presentation slides and a transcribed example dialogue handled by the system.
 In order to test the code, the Furhat remote API needs to be on (on the SDK). 
 
 Run the code with 
 
 ```bash
yarn exec ts-node main.ts
```
