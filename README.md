## Furhat the Spoken Language Instructor (Final course project for L2319 - Dialogue Systems II) - Anni Nieminen

 This respository holds my code as well as additional sound files for the final course project of L2319.
 This repository also holds my project presentation slides, a transcribed example dialogue handled by the system and a demo video.
 In order to test the code, the Furhat remote API needs to be on (on the SDK). 
 Also, the LLMs need to be retrieved from mltgpu.
 
 Run the code with 
 
 ```bash
yarn exec ts-node main.ts
```
